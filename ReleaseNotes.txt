Compatibility
-------------
The removal of PIN_KEYX from Standard Core Library (ASACORE-1641) has introduced
inter-version inter-operability issue such that the samples will not connect to
a pre-15.04 routing node that requires security. More details are available in
the Core 15.04 release notes.  The samples using security will also not
inter-operate with their pre-15.04 peers.
